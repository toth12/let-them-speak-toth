What I did:

- non compact version that links project folder 
- docker can be started in different ways: seed,build-db, default
- ssh to the container
- admin user with sudo rights
- virtual environment added
- project compile when included
- BlackLab folder changed

Problem: user password how to add

Further todos:

- everything in bash
Init.sh level: debugging  | daemon
Type: default, seed, real_data
- admin password
- rights to set up, for instance, admin can run npm run production with sudo, without sudo it is not connected to Tomcat
