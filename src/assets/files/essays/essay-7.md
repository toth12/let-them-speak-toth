In the farewell messages of A. and V., there is not much about the historical circumstances of their persecutions. Through their last messages, I can learn of only two more concrete things: they were aware of the fate that was awaiting them and they were suffering emotionally. These are the words of V.


><i>The paths of fate are wonderful and unforeseeable! I never thought there would come a time when I would envy your Father and acknowledge with relief what had happened to him. It was for the better, at least he was spared all the agitation that we are going through. At least he ended his path on Earth in his bed, treated by a doctor and surrounded by his loved ones. But how will we end ours?</i>[[1](#fn-1)]

The "luck" of those who had died before persecution is a leitmotif in testimonies. Itka Zygmuntowicz, a Polish survivor of Auschwitz, noted how lucky her grandmother was because she had died before the beginning of persecutions.[[2](#fn-2)]

Similarly, Ruth (Rita) Harmelin, a Romanian survivor, noted the luck of her grandmother who had died in her own bed.[[3](#fn-3)]

"Being lucky to die" is a trope of suffering. Literally, it conveys what V. said in her farewell letter: being spared from aggravation through death. Similar tropes of suffering <i>recur</i> through testimonies of survivors. Consider, for instance, the trope of "crying like a baby" in the testimony by Rachel G., who was sent into hiding by her parents.

><i>Just like I told you, I remember the tramway. I remember my father crying like a baby in the middle of the street while he was taking me to those people-- and to strangers. And he explained to me-- don't forget, you're Jewish, little girl. We're going to see you again. But you must do that, and you must go away. And we're doing this for your best. Because of course, I couldn't understand. My mother was crying, and only my father could take me. And he explained to me, you've got to go. This is for your [own] good. This is for your [own] good. This is the best for you. So I went out to the tramway with those people. And this was just before my birthday. And the last time I saw my father was on my birthday.</i>[[4](#fn-4)]

We all <i>understand</i> the emotional pain of separation. We can conceive it without understanding the historical context. Understanding when, why, and how this episode took place is not necessary to imagine what must have been going on in the soul of Rachel G. and her father who was "crying like a baby." The reason why we understand it is because human suffering has some degree of universality. The historical and cultural context of suffering (when, why, and how one suffers) vary, but the bulk of human suffering remains familiar to everyone living in any historical time. Suffering is the aspect of the collective experience that connects us with victims in the remote past.[[5](#fn-5)]

Suffering is also shared by the survivor and the Voiceless. This is what Gerda Kahan, a German survivor, put into words.[[6](#fn-6)]

Of course, our modern understanding of the victims’ suffering is limited. As victims themselves have often noted, complete understanding of their suffering is not possible. A survivor described this in the following words.[[7](#fn-7)]

For instance, the 'emotional death' often described by victims remains out of our grasp. Again I am quoting a survivor.[[8](#fn-8)]

Even though the victims’ suffering as a <i>complete whole</i> cannot be grasped; it can be understood <i>piece by piece</i>. We can understand those micro episodes (forced separation, seeing parents beaten up, etc.) that must have paved the way to 'emotional death.'

Understanding human suffering, however, is not a conventional analytical understanding of historical events and facts. While many actions of the perpetrators can be explained, victims’ suffering resists any effort at explanation. Consider the following episode told by a survivor of Auschwitz.[[9](#fn-9)]

This episode can be explained from the perspective of the perpetrator. Around the Auschwitz complex, private companies exploiting the labour of victims were mushrooming.[[10](#fn-10)] These companies (the "manufacturers" in the episode above) operated sub-camps where the selected victims were transferred to work. But this explanation has little or no relevance from the perspective of the victim. From her perspective, the focal point of the episode is the emotional pain of forced separation and not the historical circumstance; the reason ("need for workforce") why they picked her sister is secondary. We can understand her very human suffering through empathy and not through analytical reasoning. While the analytical and contextual reasoning anchors her suffering in the remote past and renders her as an <i>other</i>, the empathic understanding of forced separation brings her fate close to the present.[[11](#fn-11)]

Building an empathetic understanding of the Voiceless victims’ suffering is crucial now when the last survivors are dying. Until now the survivors could remember them as humans. Following their death the Voiceless will become a number ("the six million") without a human face. Through collective suffering, not only can we bridge the gap between the present and the remote, we can also memorialize the Voiceless as humans.

We have seen how <i>recurrence</i> helps retrieve the pieces of collective suffering. Next, we will see how these pieces can be rendered in a tangible format; again, memory will help find the adequate representation.

Dominick LaCapra writes, "I think historiography involves an element of objectification, and objectification may perhaps be related to the phenomenon of numbing in trauma itself. As a counterforce to numbing, empathy may be understood in terms of attending to, even trying, in limited ways, to recapture the possibility split-off, affective dimensions of the experience of others."
