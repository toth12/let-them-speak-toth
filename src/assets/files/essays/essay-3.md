How A. and V. experienced what was happening to them remains unknown. As a <i>matter of fact</i>, I <i>know</i> only one thing about their fate. Like other Jews of their home town, they were forced to board on a train in the last days of spring in 1944. This train took them to Auschwitz, from where they never returned. I know this from a fragment of a letter that a stranger who travelled with them sent to my family much later. The letter fragment does not offer any concrete insight into how A. and V. experienced their persecutions; it ends with an eerie sentence.

><i>I know nothing about your family.</i> [[1](#fn-1)]

I <i>know</i> what the perpetrators did to those who did not return. By drawing on the testimonies of the survivors, I can also <i>imagine</i> how A. and V. or the Voiceless experienced what was happening to them.
Based on a testimony by a Hungarian survivor, Freda Weiss, I can, for instance, imagine the moment when they were forced to board the train to Auschwitz.

><i>FW: And then the-- the Hungarian took us, very rough, by the hands, and threw us on the trains, in those cattle trains. In fact, when they threw my mother, she fell on the steps from the train. And she start screaming. Because her ribs wasn't healed yet, from the fall before. And we went in, in the trains. There was thousands of peoples, children, men, women, old, young, babies, crying in the arms of their mothers.</i> [[2](#fn-2)]

Another testimony by a Polish survivor, Mark Bader, let me imagine what must have happened at the moment when they arrived at Auschwitz.

><i>The Germans came, the SS troopers, when we arrived in Auschwitz, took these babies and threw them against the train and threw them down on the ground, stepped on their heads with their boots. [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] This was such a chaos. And they were running around. The SS group was hitting people with the butts of their rifle, rifle butts. Dogs were barking and biting. It was like-- [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] seemed like you just arrived in hell. And it was a picture that I will never forget. Mothers crying. They took the babies away from them. They threw them on the floor. They stepped on their heads, threw them against the car. Old people, they kicked and beat and, and hit them constantly with rifle. Blood was all over. [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] And then they-- [PAUSES FOR 4 SECONDS] then they was an officer there who was-- to me, it looked like a little baton, in the faces, right and left, right and left.</i> [[3](#fn-3)]

The survivors’ accounts such as the ones above let me <i>imagine</i> what happened from the perspective of the Voiceless. But if I accept their last wish as an ethical legacy, I also want to <i>know</i> it.

The heart of the matter is that no firm knowledge about the Voiceless and their experience emerges from the accounts of the survivors. Survivors often speak about the Voiceless; they often describe the emotional and physical reactions of children, women, and the old. But what we hear about the Voiceless is always changing. When taken away from their parents, children are <i>sometimes</i> crying; <i>sometimes</i> they are quiet. The old are <i>sometimes</i> begging for their lives; <i>sometimes</i> they are numb. The "evidence" about those who were bound to perish is always changing. History has no method to back up the truth of the always changing evidence; the co-existence of multiple truths (<i>sometimes</i> crying <i>sometimes not</i> crying) is absurd: a historical fact is either true or false. 

There are further difficulties when we want to know how the Voiceless experienced what happened to them. What we hear about the Voiceless in the testimonies of the survivors is indirect and secondhand. Strictly speaking, the Voiceless do not speak in testimonies.

Consequently, we can form factual knowledge of what the perpetrators did, but how the Voiceless experienced their persecutions must remain in the realm of fiction and imagination. Any effort to reconstruct the voice of the Voiceless is a futile and absurd undertaking for a discipline that centers its epistemology around the true or false facts.

Nevertheless, behind this futile and absurd undertaking there is an ethical dilemma: can we accept that the history of the Voiceless equals the history of the perpetrators? In light of their last wish, "tell the world and remember us," this cannot be accepted. Instead, we need a new epistemology by means of which we can <i>know</i> the experience of the Voiceless.

Strangely, this puts us into the same shoes as physics was at the beginning of the twentieth century. Methods of traditional physics could not address that a physical entity without tangible existence can be in multiple states at the same time. As Erwin Schrödinger's famous thought experiment pinpointed, from the perspective of traditional physics the fact that Schrödinger's cat (representing the invisible physical entity) could exist in multiple contradictory states (dead and alive) at the same time was absurd. Similarly, knowing anything about the experience of the Voiceless, a historical group that has no direct and tangible existence in the present, is absurd. Just as Schrödinger's cat can be in multiple contradictory states, the Voiceless can be in different emotional states (<i>begging for life</i> or <i>numb</i>, for instance). Just as an epistemological turn was needed in physics to reconstruct the intangible world of atoms, in history an epistemological term would be needed to <i>know</i> how the Voiceless experienced their persecutions. If physics could form firm knowledge of the always changing non-existent, history should be also able to cope with the challenge.

To address this new epistemology, I will first find a path from the survivor testimonies to the Voiceless. Next I turn towards the way survivors faced their own traumatic pasts.
