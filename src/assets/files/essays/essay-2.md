A few years ago something unexpected happened. My late grandfather’s cousin gave me approximately two hundred letters. They were written by my ancestors during and after the Holocaust; the authors, among others, are my great-great-grandmother and her sister, A. and V., who were deported from a Transylvanian town in the late spring of 1944. They both left farewell letters. In her last message, V. also left a last wish.

><i>Think of us every now and again, who had to suffer for being born.</i> [[1](#fn-1)]

V. was one of those many victims who asked to be remembered. In their testimonies, survivors often recall the last wish of the Voiceless.

In 1981 Suzanne Claire Holzer-Wester, a Polish survivor of Auschwitz, gave a testimony to her daughter. In her testimony she recalled the last wish of those who were destined to perish.

><i>... when we went there, they took us to unload like some wood, coal or corpses, whatever they transported, and people were sitting  on at the train, on the trains that we passed on the way, and they were already dead those people, they couldn't walk, couldn't talk, kept on saying we should say Kaddish for them, we should remember them.</i> [[2](#fn-2)]

A memory fragment by Leo Bretholz, an Austrian-born survivor, also perpetuates a last message from the Voiceless, as well as the perpetrators’ effort to silence it.

><i>One time the train stopped at a station, and the people there, seeing it, wanted to reach me. We shouted "Water!" The -- they didn't let them get close because these people were aware of three transports going by there every week. Some of the people were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply because some of us. And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends. But some of them, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in Drancy or hiding out somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would put stamps on them and mail them. Or just notes: "We are going away. We are going away. Don't forget us." Cryptic notes like this, you see. But they didn't let them approach.</i> [[3](#fn-3)]

Others were trying to leave their last wish by engraving it into walls and objects. In his testimony, Leizer Hoffer recalled inscriptions he found in a town in Moldova.

><i>It was Jewish people because we had mezuzahs on the doors and messages on the walls. So we realized that those people must have been taken out of their homes. And of course, after they were gone, everything was looted. But in the house we were in there wasn't very much, just the four walls. But on the walls and on the doors, in Yiddish and in whatever language, messages. And the messages were loud and clear. First thing, say kaddish for us. Don't forget us. Tell the world what happened to us-- everywhere. That message stays with me. I'll carry it. And I'll pass it on. [CRYING] We owe it to those people that obviously were taken out of their homes and murdered.</i> [[4](#fn-4)]

The last wish from the Voiceless is an ethical legacy that carries the obligation to remember them. This legacy has different meanings from different perspectives.

For survivors the obligation to memorialize the Voiceless meant telling what happened to them through their own personal stories and remembering their loved ones who perished. The often heard message <i>Tell the world what happened to us</i> expresses this obligation.

For the historian the obligation to remember the Voiceless translates into the task of reconstructing truthfully and objectively <i>what</i> happened to them and <i>why</i>. Inevitably, the main protagonist of these reconstructions is the perpetrator who acts; the Voiceless is the passive subject who perishes; the unspeakable cruelty and the "genius" of the perpetrators are the at heart of the narration. The Voiceless are represented as a number ("the six million") and their human sufferings are sidelined. A different setting is possible when writing about a murdered victim who left a diary, letters or participated in resistance groups that left historical records. When telling the history of those millions whom the word Voiceless refers to, however, a narrative setting that brings the perpetrators and their actions into the fore seems to be unavoidable.

From the perspective of the Voiceless this is troublesome; they could hardly have wished to be remembered through the deeds of their tormentors or only as names and numbers. The last wish of the Voiceless must also involve the <i>truthful</i>, the <i>objective</i>, and the <i>unquestionable</i> reconstruction of <i>how</i> they experienced <i>what</i> happened to them. We need <i>documentation</i> of not only what perpetrators did but also the <i>subjective realities</i> in which the Voiceless had to live. <i>Tell the world what happened to us</i>  also implies the obligation to find the truth of subjective mental, emotional, and physical experiences that any victim, including the Voiceless, had to go through.

The last wish that survivors have memorialized assigns two very tangible tasks: complementing the history of what the perpetrators did with the subjective realities of the Voiceless and inquiring into the place of these subjective realities in human history. Symbolically, the accomplishment of these two tasks in this book will also give voices to the Voiceless.
