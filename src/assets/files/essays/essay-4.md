The disappearance of A. and V. was a great sorrow for those who survived them. Sometime after 1945 my great-grandmother, the daughter of A., sent a letter to her brother. To console him, she closed her letter with the following words.


><i>Don’t give yourself to despair, this is our destiny shared with millions, we have so far endured it - but until when?!</i> [[1](#fn-1)]

Finding consolation in the shared destiny is a leitmotif in the testimonies of the survivors. They often recall the memory of gathering with other survivors and talking over the collectively endured experience of persecutions.

Nesse Goding, who lived through persecutions from the age of 13 to 17, recalls this experience in her testimony.

><i>... even my aunt who loved me, who helped me, my cousins that were dear to me, they always said, you suffered enough, don’t talk about it. So who did we, we talk to about it? Survivors to each other! We started to, because we didn’t have families, ... Five, six couples, survivors coming to our house on the Sabbath, having a little lunch, what did we talk about? The Holocaust. Comparing each other’s suffering, telling how it was.</i> [[2](#fn-2)]

Jacob Rosenber, a Polish survivor, tells what motivated survivors to gather and address the collectively endured experience of persecutions.

><i>INT: Did you talk to people a lot about your experiences?
JR: We constantly talk about the experience, constantly.<br/>
INT: Who do you talk to?<br/>
JR: Mostly to-- to survivors, mostly to survivors, they understand better than anybody else. They understand the nonspoken word. There is a language which is behind, beyond words they understand.</i> [[3](#fn-3)]

"Understanding the unspoken word" is another a leitmotif in testimonies; it suggests an invisible community of shared experience that connected all victims. Another survivor, Dora Freilich, described the shared experience as "a silent bond" connecting victims.

><i>And we kept together, the survivors. It was something, there was a silent bond between us that remains up until this day. We tried to live near each other and to come together, go together. We talked, we went to the movies, we went to the theater, we started to live again. We were also trying to decide what we are going to do with our lives.</i>[[4](#fn-4)]

Beyond the collectively endured experience and the mutual understanding of each other’s pain, there was also something else that held the community of survivors together: the last wish of the Voiceless. Madeline Deutsch, a survivor who was born in former Czechoslovakia, put this into words.

><i>Well, let's see, when we started with this group, you know, the Holocaust survivors, we got together for two reasons. Number one was for each other and that we can share some of it with each other, those who survived it, who understand it, who, we can just look at one another and we know what the other one means, because there is such communication that it doesn't have to be verbal and in this case, the Holocaust survivors practically don't have to talk about things to understand one another. So this is a communication that is definitely between just survivors. And the other reason that came up a little bit later, because we remembered when some of the people who were killed and they said, their last breath, remember us, don't, not let us, do not let them forget us. And basically, I mean that's not, you know, word for word, that was basically what they kept asking before they went to their deaths. Do not let us, do not let them forget us. So this was a promise that probably all of us that survived made to ourselves, that we will not let the world forget them, because these were all decent human beings and they were just killed because they were Jews, or the other six million who were not Jews, but for various not important reasons, that they were being killed as well. So this was one of the other things that we have promised, that we will not let the world forget what happened and what they did to them. And so, as the war ended, the other thing that besides trying to find our families and trying to make a new life for ourselves, we also wanted to talk about the people that were killed and so when we started this group, the Holocaust survivors, one of our major reasons to getting together was to try to create some kind of a memorial to remember all these six million Jews that were murdered for no other reason that they, that they were Jews.</i> [[5](#fn-5)]

These memory fragments of survivors suggest that the collectively endured experience and the voice of the Voiceless are bound together.  The path to voice of the Voiceless must lead through the collective experience of persecutions.

Nearly fifty years after the end of the war, a survivor of Auschwitz,  Fritzie Fritzshall, returned to the camp. Her recollection of this journey helps uncover this path.

> <i>When I went back to -- to Auschwitz several years ago, back then -- ‘93, I believe, there’s a room in Auschwitz where it has all luggage, suitcases. I walked into this room and the first suitcase that stares at me is Weiss, W-e-i-s-s. That was my maiden name. Do I know if it was ours? No. Would I recognize it? No. Could it have been? Yes.</i> [[6](#fn-6)]

Just as the suitcases in the Auschwitz Museum could have belonged to anyone who was deported to the camp, there must be a set of experiences that <i>could have been</i> the experience of any of the six million victims. This set of shared experiences is the collectively endured fate that established the "silent bonds" among survivors.

The Voiceless' individual and their very concrete experience certainly perished with them. Nevertheless, through the collective experience of persecutions we can still approach their fate. This is how a survivor put it into words.

><i>My father's sister went and her daughter. Her husband, too, had died young, so that was one less to go. My father's sister fought in the battle of Warsaw. She was killed in it. Her daughter, who was, I think 12, was taken away from her to Auschwitz and was gassed—my first cousin who I spent my summers with at my home. I mourn for them. But I mourn really only collectively for my grandmother. And every film I've ever seen about the Holocaust, about the camps, I see only her face. She is the primary face. And when I see children in camps, I think of my playmates.</i> [[7](#fn-7)]

Collective experience understood as a <i>set</i> incorporating what <i>could have been</i> the experience of <i>any</i> victim again takes us back to Schrodinger’s cat. 

Based on the suitcase analogy, we can define collective experience as a set of possibilities. What the Voiceless experienced as a matter of fact cannot be reconstructed; what they were <i>likely</i> to experience can be reconstructed, however, through the collective experience. But collective experience defined as a certain <i>world of possibilities</i> is not meaningful for history. The concept world of possibilities is absurd for a discipline that can recognize <i>only</i> true or false facts as valid backbones of knowledge. 

Schrödinger’s cat pinpointed a very similar problem. From the perspective of traditional physics, the study of physical entities that can be approached only through likelihood was absurd. The epistemological turn we need in order to reconstruct how the Voiceless experienced their persecution is the acceptance of <i>world of possibilities</i> as a valid form of knowledge.

Next, we will see what <i>world of possibilities</i> meant from the victims’ perspective. This will help outline how we can reconstruct collective experience as a set of possibilities from thousands of testimonies.
