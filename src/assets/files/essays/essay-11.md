I remember asking a survivor in my family whether it is possible to give any explanation of what happened to her and her family. I clearly remember her answer: it was a definite no.

The impossibility of giving explanation of what and why it happened is a leitmotif in the testimonies of survivors.

Fani Birnberg Ross, a Polish survivor, finished her testimony with the following words.

><i>Q: Is there anything else you wish to add? <br/><br/>
A: I wish there had...I don't know why, why we were persecuted. I don't know why. I'm thinking at night sometimes. I don't know why till today.</i> [[1](#fn-1)]

Other survivors pointed out the impossibility of explanation by repeating phrases such as "for no reason" and "without reason." Zygmund Shipper, a Polish survivor who lived through persecutions as a child, described his grandfather’s humiliation with one of these phrases.

><i>But of course children like my age, you know, we got away with it, we walked. But the thing was, you know, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he was a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in Lódz. They used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are they doing, you know, I didn’t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that? They said, purely to humiliate him, you know, because they know it’s the most terrible thing to have that beard cut off. And then they made him wash the pavement, for no reason at all, just to degrade him, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you’re not even 10 years old, you cannot understand why and you keep asking question and there is like always, there’s -- there’s no answers why.</i> [[2](#fn-2)]

Others used words such as "senseless" or "irrational" to describe what happened to them and to their family. George Havas, a Hungarian survivor, described the episodes of his persecution as irrational.

><i>And I didn't want to go in, I was waiting, again it was odd that they should have taken us that far by train just to kill us now, but at this point there were so many inconsistencies and so many irrational, one thing after another, that I wasn't sure any more about anything and when I saw them coming out I went in and then the shower could hold, I guess maybe 25-30 people, it was not a big room like some places, like Auschwitz had for example, or some others.</i> [[3](#fn-3)]

Irrationality is the heart of the history of persecutions from the victims’ perspective. Their inability to understand <i>what</i> and <i>why</i> this was happening to them recurs through their memories. In light of this, we must ask the question, what is the place of victims’ irrational suffering shown through testimonial fragments in human history?

There is an irresolvable contradiction between victims’ meaningless suffering and history as a meaningful process. Human history is a sequence of events that is believed to be explicable. For instance, plausible explanations can be elaborated to account for why and what happened during the Holocaust. But these explanations inevitably and unintentionally sideline the victims’ perspective. Any form of explanation is also a process of rationalization, which remains at odds with victims’ irrational suffering. What words of survivors clearly tell us is that their suffering cannot be approached with any meaning- making strategy. Nevertheless, this does not mean that explaining the Holocaust as a historical or social event is neither necessary nor possible; it means that these explanations will always remain in contrast with the heart of  the victims' suffering: irrationality and lack of any meaningful explanation of what and why it happened.

The unresolvable contradiction between the victims’ irrational experience and the explicable nature of human history also means that the Holocaust has two histories. One of them is the history of persecutions; the other is the history of the victims’ suffering. The former revolves around what, why, and how perpetrators acted; the latter is the history of the victims' suffering. Both histories are necessary, but their methods, goals, and understanding of truth are fundamentally different.

The history of these persecutions aims to uncover and understand the events, actions, cultural, and social structures that led to the mass destruction of European Jewry and other persecuted groups. The history of persecutions can be approached with the intention of explanation. The history of victims’ suffering aims to memorialize victims by revealing the emotional, mental and physical experiences that gave rise to their suffering. These experiences cannot be approached with the intention of meaning-making; they can be approached only by empathy. The Holocaust as a history of persecutions is the history of <i>inhuman</i> cruelty; the Holocaust as a history of suffering is the history of very <i>human</i> experiences that victims went through.

To recover the truth and form objective knowledge, a history of persecution draws on facts. To find the truth, a history of victims’  suffering draws on the collective voice of victims; it understands the truth not as what happened in reality but as what victims were likely to face.

For the history of persecutions, the voice of the Voiceless does not exist; yet, their Voice is an utterly absurd concept. In contrast, given that the history of victims’ suffering draws on collective experience, it also includes the voice of the Voiceless. 

While the history of persecutions is a somewhat coherent story that can be told by a historian, the history of victims’ suffering is inherently incoherent and fragmented; it cannot be narrated as a coherent story; it can only be rendered through fragments that are narrated by those who were there as victims. The overall goal of the history of the Holocaust as a history of suffering is to let victims speak for themselves and tell the fragments of their sufferings.

For all these reasons, the two histories cannot be connected; they fundamentally remain two parallel histories. Beyond sheer causality, the deeds of the perpetrators and the victims’ suffering are not connected and they cannot be told as one integrated history. The historian and survivor, Saul Friedlander, put this into words.

><i>... no single concept allows us to interpret the history of the perpetrators, that of the bystanders, and that of victims as intertwined processes with entirely diverse origins and dynamics that converged at a given point in time. They shared part of the same context, but the forces that determined their evolution were thoroughly different. Most of the conceptual frameworks used up until now in the historiography of the Shoah apply essentially to Nazi policies (and, even within these limits, none of these frameworks has been recognized as the most plausible one) and thus relegate the other dimensions of this history to marginality.</i> [[4](#fn-4)]
