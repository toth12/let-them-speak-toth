I remember asking a survivor in my family whether it is possible to give any explanation of what happened to her and her family. I clearly remember her answer: it was a definite no.

The impossibility of giving explanation of what and why it happened is a leitmotif in the testimonies of survivors.

Fani Birnberg Ross, a Polish survivor, finished her testimony with the following words.[[1](#fn-1)]

Other survivors pointed out the impossibility of explanation by repeating phrases such as "for no reason" and "without reason." Zygmund Shipper, a Polish survivor who lived through persecutions as a child, described the humiliation of the old with one of these phrases.[[2](#fn-2)]

Others used words such as "senseless" or "irrational" to describe what happened to them and to their family. George Havas, a Hungarian survivor, described the episodes of his persecution as irrational.[[3](#fn-3)]

Irrationality is the heart of victims’ experience. Their inability to understand <i>what</i> and <i>why</i> this was happening to them recurs through their memories.

There is an irresolvable contradiction between victims’ meaningless suffering and history as a meaningful process. Human history is a sequence of events that is believed to be explicable. For instance, plausible explanations can be elaborated to account for why and what happened during the Holocaust. But any form of explanation is also a process of rationalization, which remains at odds with victims’ irrational suffering. What words of survivors clearly tell us is that their suffering cannot be approached with any meaning- making strategy. 

Nevertheless, this does not mean that explaining the Holocaust as a historical or social event is neither necessary nor possible; it means that these explanations will <i>always</i> remain in contrast with the heart of the victims' perspectives.

The unresolvable contradiction between the victims’ irrational experience and the explicable nature of human history also means that the Holocaust has two histories. One of them is the history of persecutions; the other is the history of the victims’ suffering. The former revolves around what, why, and how perpetrators acted; the latter addresses how victims experienced their persecutions. Both histories are necessary, but they are fundamentally different.

To recover the truth and form an objective knowledge of what happened, the history of persecutions draws on facts. In this framework, the voice of the Voiceless cannot be approached; yet, it is an utterly absurd concept. To find the truth of victims' subjective experiences, history of victims’ suffering can draw on world of possibilities. Most importantly, by reconstructing the world of possibilities in which victims lived, history of victims’ suffering can attain the experience of murdered victims. Again, as a matter of fact we will never know how the Voiceless experienced persecutions. Nevertheless, we can definitely know their most likely emotional, mental, and physical experiences; through the collective voice we can hear their voices as well.

Throughout the previous chapters I have occassionally referred to Schrödinger's cat. A significance of this thought experiment is given by that it can be used to compare different epistemological systems. From a common sense point of view the fact that a cat closed in a box can be both alive and dead is absurd and contradictory. However, the contradiction can be resolved once the existence of the cat is approached through an epistemology that draws on probabilistic descriptions of the world. From the perspective of quantum mechanics, the fact that the cat is both alive and dead is meaningful and not absurd. 

Similarly, the voice of the Voiceless (the experiences of millions who perished) is absurd for the common sense. It is however meaningful for any epistemology that relies on probabilities.

Today, for the Humanities probabilistic epistemologies whereby the voice of Voiceless is meaningful might sound useless and redundant. However, infinitely large digital universes (alias Big Data) are proliferating in the Humanities as well; in these large universes there are no facts but only probabilities.

<p id="fn-4" class="footnote">Amos Goldberg describes victims' experience as the collapse of meaning producing system: "Trauma is an experience at the heart of which lies a void; an experience in which the shock is so immense that it cannot be completely woven into the cognitive and physichic systems, and thus, to a certain extent, remains external to them. Traumatic experience is an encounter with a tangible lack that refuses to be integrated into systems of meaning - including those of narrative. (..) Not only does void escape all human meaning (hence the terror it evokes) and not only does it threaten to disintegratethe way in which we afford meaning to the events of our lives (i.e. our narrative identities), but it jeopardizes the mechanism by which meaning is afforded: the conceptual network that enables meaning in the first place." Goldberg, "Trauma in first person narratives", p.247. See also, Langer, "Ruins of Memory", p. 12; S. Felman and D. Laub <i>Testimony Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis and History</i> (Florence: Taylor and Francis, 2013).</p>
<p id="fn-5" class="footnote">5. The historian and survivor, Saul Friedlander, writes, "... no single concept allows us to interpret the history of the perpetrators, that of the bystanders, and that of victims as intertwined processes with entirely diverse origins and dynamics that converged at a given point in time. They shared part of the same context, but the forces that determined their evolution were thoroughly different. Most of the conceptual frameworks used up until now in the historiography of the Shoah apply essentially to Nazi policies (and, even within these limits, none of these frameworks has been recognized as the most plausible one) and thus relegate the other dimensions of this history to marginality." sSaul Friedlander, "On historical modernism" in:  Probing the ethics of Holocaust Culture, ed. by. W. Kansteiner, C. Fogu, and T. Presner (Cambridge, MA : Harvard University Press, 2016), p. 74.</p>
