Once I asked a survivor in my family, what was the worst experience you had during persecutions? I was staggered to hear her answer. She told me something I had never heard before from her or from other survivors in my family. Since I am unable to convey what she told me, I am citing a Lithuanian survivor, Lily Margules, who went through the same experience in a different camp.

><i>And they told us right away to line up and to get undressed. Naked! You know, one, you are only a person as soon...as long as you have your clothes on. You can be a professor. You can be a doctor. You can be a scientist. You can be a shoemaker. But as long...as soon as your clothes come up and you stand naked, you are lost. You are not a human being anymore. This is what I cannot...what I cannot forgive the Germans that they...they took off our...systematically take...took away our dignity. But undressing us, many of the girls were young girls. They were virgins. They never saw their parents naked, never saw their mothers naked, but all of a sudden we...we have to go and get undressed.</i>[[1](#fn-1)]

The painful experience of being forced to be naked <i>recurs through</i> the testimonies of survivors. While <i>some</i> men and women address the mental and emotional weight that this episode had for them, <i>others</i> are silent about it.

Henia Bryer, a Polish survivor, was deported to Plaszow, a concentration camp close to Cracow. Her words echo what I heard.

><i>And then things-- a lot of things happened all of a sudden, after a few weeks when we were in Plaszow. And also, they had another thing that you had to strip and walk naked in the camp so that they can do these awful selections. Every couple of weeks. It was the most dreadful thing. You can imagine how you feel when you're asked to strip. And I mean, we were brought up in a Jewish home. I wouldn't even strip for my mother in the bathroom. Used to lock the door when I went to have my bath or things like that. And they had to strip naked, whether it was summer or winter, and to walk in the camp for all these Germans to look. They were walking around with riding crops and making remarks, ugly remarks, while we were doing it. So it was pretty awful.</i> [[2](#fn-2)]

Similarly, Shari B., who was deported from the Slovakian town, Kosice, shared the mental impact of forced undressing.

><i>And so then, I came to Theresienstadt. And I was still like a mad woman. And I remember the next for me terrible thing was that when we came there, there were all kinds of epidemics going on. And they shaved not our hair, but the rest of the hair on our body. And we were lying there naked, sort of exposed. And suddenly, these SS men came to the room. And sort of they were walking around and-- and looking at us. And I remember thinking that this is the most terrible moment, much worse-- I felt totally dehumanized. I hated them so much that they should-- they should see me naked. It was somehow terrible. And so I decided that-- that I don't want to live.</i>[[3](#fn-3)]

G. Hirschfeld was born in Berlin and went through the same procedure, but his account does not address the mental and emotional aspects of forced nakedness.

><i>A: We were told to strip completely naked at the time. This was the eastern part of Germany and still very, very cold, and I remember we had to strip completely naked and run completely naked from one block, meaning barrack to another barrack and there we were waiting for some instruction or whatnot. I remember waiting. It was very, very cold.</i>[[4](#fn-4)]

The experience of forced nudity was definitely part of the victims’ collective fate. Millions, both the survivors and the Voiceless, had to undergo this procedure. The sheer fact that it happened often is well-known and well-documented. The same cannot be said about the emotional and mental weight of this episode. This resists any effort of <i>documentation</i>. As a matter of fact, we do not know how and what victims felt at the moment they were forced to undress; any effort to <i>document</i> this intrinsically subjective aspect of the experience would sound absurd.

Nevertheless, as the examples above demonstrate, the emotional and mental weight does <i>recur</i> through the testimonies of the survivors. <i>Sometimes</i> we hear about it, <i>sometimes</i> we do <i>not</i>. We cannot document the emotional aspects, but we can definitely observe its <i>recurrence</i> in the testimonies of the survivors.

From a quantitative point of view, recurrence is probability. Recurrence describes the probability of observing the same thing again and again.  In the testimonies of the survivors, recurrence of certain episodes and their emotional and mental impact, such as "being forced to undress naked," gives evidence for the possibility that any victim was likely to face this. Recurrence is in fact the key to reconstructing collective experience as a set of possibilities: given a reasonably large corpus of survivors’ testimonies, pieces of the collective experience <i>must recur</i>.

For instance, the emotional impact of forced nakedness occurs in <i>some</i> but not all</i> victims’ accounts. Whether every victim experienced it we do not know; however, given that it recurs in the testimonies of survivors we can definitely <i>know</i> that <i>any victim</i>, including the Voiceless, <i>was likely</i> to experience it. Recurrence also demonstrates that the emotional and mental impact that the excerpts of testimony above address <i>could have been</i> the experience of any victim. We can thus <i>document</i> the emotional and mental impact of forced undressing by drawing on the collective voice reachable through recurrence.

With the help of recurrence, we can also challenge the intrinsic subjectivity of individual memories and break the silence on painful memories. Again, not all discuss the painful experience of forced undressing, but those who do speak up on behalf of others, including the Voiceless.

To sum up, through recurrence we can reconstruct the world of possibilities where the victims were forced to live. The experiences that recur in the narrations of the survivors are part of a shared past. But recurrence itself does not answer another question that the recovery of the collective experience involves: What are the aspects of the collective experience that connect the survivor and the Voiceless with us? 

The collective experience of the victims is anchored in a remote past that is fundamentally different from our present. To hear the voice of the Voiceless through collective experience we need to find a bridge that can cross the gap between the past and present.  To find this bridge, I again return to my own memory.
