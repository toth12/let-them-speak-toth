Survivors in my family have often invoked the memory of the so-called "ghetto march," which was a frequent episode of persecutions. In the early spring of 1944 my grandfather and his family were forced to leave their home and to move to a place (the "ghetto") where all the Jews of their home town had to stay before their deportation to camps. When moving to the "ghetto" they were forced to march through the streets of their town. Since I cannot recall how they recalled their memories of the ghetto march, I am quoting the words of another survivor who went through the same procedure in another town.

><i>And in the street where we lived, there were few Jews. It was a mixed neighborhood, so there were about four Jewish families. And they were all packed, and the gendarmes came, and they took us into towards another street where there were some more Jews. They put us in the center of the street where the cars and horses were driven, and they started to force us to march to the ghetto. ... Those very neighbors in whose courtyard I played in as a child-- those very neighbors who were guests at my mother's dining room table months before peeked through the windows and turned their faces. And as I look back now, strange that it pains me so much. That trek through the main street in the middle of the street, driven like cattle, with the valises, with the baggages, with my little nieces, with the little infant who was five, six weeks old. ... These neighbors who used to pinch my cheek when I was a little girl, they stood and watched stony-faced as we were driven to this town with the Hungarian gendarme using two truncheons on old people who couldn't walk fast enough. It was so shameful, so humiliating.</i> [[1](#fn-1)]

In addition to telling how humiliating the "ghetto march" was, my grandfather and his sister <i>kept telling</i> another memory: the sight of my great-grandfather crying when they were driven through the town. For <i>me</i> the episode of ghetto march with the memory of the "crying father" exemplified the <i>emotional reality</i> of persecutions.

The moment of seeing their father crying was an emotional landmark for my grandfather and his sister. So it was for others. The experience of seeing one’s parents crying recurs over the testimonies of survivors.

Alice Eberstarkova Masters was born in Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). She survived because her parents could send her to England. This is her description of the last time she saw her parents.

><i>The morning that we were leaving we heard -- we heard my father cry for the first time. I've never heard my father cry. The tears -- now, it's going to difficult. Because it's one of the most difficult things that happened. See, I've never heard -- we were all packed to go, and suddenly we heard this noise coming from another room. And we looked at each other in horror because my father was weeping loud. And that was everybody that was sleeping. That's when we realized how awful it's going to be. This is difficult now.</i>[[2](#fn-2)]

Sylvia Ebner, another Hungarian survivor, describes the last night she spent together with her parents before the deportation.

><i>SE: That was about 50 miles from us, where we lived, but that was exactly one--next day after our Jewish Easter, next day.<br/><br/>
GS: Passover?<br/><br/>
SE: Passover, right after our Passover, but at Passover my uncle wasn’t home. He was in labor camp and my two aunts, three aunts was there and a little girl was eight years old, her name is Katy and they want to hear the seder, but how they gonna hear the seder? My uncle was in the labor camp, one of my aunt’s husbands was in the labor camp, the little girl’s father was in the labor camp, so we walked down about a mile where my aunt lived and we had the seder at their house because we don’t want all of them to walk to our place. It’s very funny when all the Jews coming to one place. My father went first, then I went, my brother wasn’t home, my brother was in that city, and then my mother further away from me, like we don’t walk together, and then we went into the house, to my aunt’s house and we had the seder. We cried through all night. My father said this, all the seder, but we cried through all night because we were so much of afraid they gonna come in, the Germans gonna break down the door. And I was at that time 14 ½ year old and I never saw my father crying in my life, but that time I saw my father and my mother crying. I couldn’t really pick it up so fast, how come my father cry? Is it really so bad? But I was shaking, because that time we cannot walk from one village to the other.</i> [[3](#fn-3)]

The experience of seeing parents crying is an important piece of the collective suffering; it can be expressed through the following memory fragments that together form a testimonial fragment.



><i>I and still [INAUDIBLE] hear the click of the breach, you know, of-- of when it was loaded. And-- and I can still hear my father crying in a very high pitched voice.</i>[[4](#fn-4)]<br/><br/>

><i>I had never seen my father cry in his life. My father cried because...because we knew that it was the end of a total existence.</i>[[6](#fn-6)] <br/><br/>



<br/><br/>
><i>And-- and the scene that I remember is that he was so moved, my father, that he just cried and cried and hugged me for a long time.</i>[[7](#fn-7)]

Continuing with the question raised earlier, what can these fragments, and the testimonies behind them, say about the emotional reality in which victims lived?

Again, an analogy drawn from a survivor’s memory helps give an answer. Decades after the end of persecutions, a survivor returned to the camps where he was deported with young students. In his testimony he recalled  the words he addressed to the young students.

><i>'You will never probably see what I'm going to see. You are never going to hear from the graves what I am going to hear. But you will see enough.'</i>[[8](#fn-8)]

By the same token, testimonial fragments do not give direct access to the emotional reality of persecutions as experienced by the victims themselves in the remote past; but through them we can still see <i>enough</i>. In other words, testimonial fragments give an <i>always incomplete</i> but <i>still sufficient</i> access to the emotional reality of the Holocaust.

The Holocaust as a <i>historical event</i> remains fundamentally different from  the normality in which we live. As it has often been said that it is an event without parallel; the <i>complete</i> emotional reality of the Voiceless will always remain beyond the human imagination.  The Holocaust can be understood and imagined <i>piece by piece</i>, however. The pain rendered by fragments of the collective suffering, such as the sight of a parent crying, can be understood by anyone living in any historical time and in any culture. The experience of deportations and the world of gas chambers have no parallel with normality, but many individual pieces of suffering do have parallels with our "normal" world. Incomplete but sufficient access to the emotional reality of persecutions is possible due to our familiarity with the emotional suffering of episodes such as forced separation and the sight of parents crying. Focus on victims’ suffering can thus counterbalance the fundamental otherness of the Holocaust as a historical event and bring victims’ experience close to us.

Even most importantly, focusing on parallels between our normal world and the victims’ suffering helps counteract the historical memory’s inevitable tendency to objectify its subjects. A survivor put this into words.

><i>When my son went to religious school, he was taught about Holocaust, and he got a lot of statistics and he got a lot of ghoulish stories and it turned him completely off. I can understand that, too. It would turn me off, too, because after a while I got desensitized, rather than sensitized to it. After you see so many pictures, even the most horrid pictures, somehow those people become like historical objects, like mummies, and there’s something emotional lost there.</i> [[9](#fn-9)]


The challenge described by the survivor (the need to avoid desensitization and the "mummification" of the Voiceless) can be only addressed by reproducing and preserving the emotional history of the Holocaust as experienced by the victims themselves. 

Survivors have preserved and transmitted the pieces of their suffering to us through a vivid oral tradition which also kept alive the emotional reality of persecutions. With the death of the last survivors, this living memory is also dying. To preserve the emotional reality for future generations, we need new representation formats, such as testimonial fragments of the collective suffering presented here, that can connect victims’ fundamentally different experience with the "normal" world in which we live.
