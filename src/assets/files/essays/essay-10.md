Survivors in my family have often invoked the memory of the so-called "ghetto march," which was a frequent episode of persecutions. In the early spring of 1944 my grandfather and his family were forced to leave their home and to move to a place (the "ghetto") where all the Jews of their home town had to stay before their deportation to camps. When moving to the "ghetto" they were forced to march through the streets of their town. Since I cannot recall how they recalled their memories of the ghetto march, I am quoting the words of another survivor who went through the same procedure in another town.[[1](#fn-1)]

In addition to telling how humiliating the "ghetto march" was, my grandfather and his sister <i>kept telling</i> another memory: the sight of my great-grandfather crying when they were driven through the town. For <i>me</i> the episode of ghetto march with the memory of the "crying father" exemplified the <i>emotional reality</i> of persecutions.

The moment of seeing their father crying was an emotional landmark for my grandfather and his sister. So it was for others. The experience of seeing one’s parents crying recurs over the testimonies of survivors.

Alice Eberstarkova Masters was born in Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). She survived because her parents could send her to England. This is her description of the last time she saw her parents.[[2](#fn-2)]

Sylvia Ebner, another Hungarian survivor, describes the last night she spent together with her parents before the deportation.[[3](#fn-3)]

The experience of seeing parents crying is an important piece of the collective suffering; it can be expressed through the following memory fragments that together form a testimonial fragment.



><i>I and still [INAUDIBLE] hear the click of the breach, you know, of-- of when it was loaded. And-- and I can still hear my father crying in a very high pitched voice.</i>[[4](#fn-4)]<br/><br/>

><i>I heard my mother screaming, crying, pleading, begging and myself sitting silently in an – an outside room.</i>[[5](#fn-5)]<br/><br/>

><i>I had never seen my father cry in his life. My father cried because...because we knew that it was the end of a total existence.</i>[[6](#fn-6)] <br/><br/>



<br/><br/>
><i>And-- and the scene that I remember is that he was so moved, my father, that he just cried and cried and hugged me for a long time.</i>[[7](#fn-7)]

Continuing with the question raised earlier, what can these fragments, and the testimonies behind them, say about the emotional reality in which victims lived?

Again, an analogy drawn from a survivor’s memory helps give an answer. Decades after the end of persecutions, a survivor returned to the camps where he was deported with young students. In his testimony he recalled  the words he addressed to the young students.[[8](#fn-8)]

By the same token, testimonial fragments do not give direct access to the emotional reality of persecutions as experienced by the victims themselves in the remote past; but through them we can still see <i>enough</i>. In other words, testimonial fragments give an <i>always incomplete</i> but <i>still sufficient</i> access to the emotional reality of the Holocaust.

The Holocaust as a <i>historical event</i> remains fundamentally different from  the normality in which we live. As it has often been said that it is an event without parallel; the <i>complete</i> emotional reality of the Voiceless will always remain beyond the human imagination.  The Holocaust can be understood and imagined <i>piece by piece</i>, however. The pain rendered by fragments of the collective suffering, such as the sight of a parent crying, can be understood by anyone living in any historical time and in any culture. The experience of deportations and the world of gas chambers have no parallel with normality, but many individual pieces of suffering do have parallels with our "normal" world. Incomplete but sufficient access to the emotional reality of persecutions is possible due to our familiarity with the emotional suffering of episodes such as forced separation and the sight of parents crying. Focus on victims’ suffering can thus counterbalance the fundamental otherness of the Holocaust as a historical event and bring victims’ experience close to us.

Even most importantly, focusing on parallels between our normal world and the victims’ suffering helps counteract the historical memory’s inevitable tendency to objectify its subjects. A survivor put this into words.[[9](#fn-9)]

The challenge described by the survivor (the need to avoid desensitization and the "mummification" of the Voiceless) can be only addressed by reproducing and preserving the emotional history of the Holocaust as experienced by the victims themselves. 

Survivors have preserved and transmitted the pieces of their suffering to us through a vivid oral tradition which also kept alive the emotional reality of persecutions. With the death of the last survivors, this living memory is also dying. To preserve the emotional reality for future generations, we need new representation formats, such as testimonial fragments of the collective suffering presented here, that can connect victims’ fundamentally different experience with the "normal" world in which we live.

In the epilogue I am addressing the relationship between history of persecutions and victims' meaningless suffering.
