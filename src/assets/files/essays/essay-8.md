Throughout the two decades I spent with survivors, I heard many stories about their persecutions. But they kept retelling us the <i>same incomplete</i> episodes of their troubled past. For instance, I remember an episode that I often heard. At some point in 1944 the city where my grandfather and his parents stayed was bombed. The next day, Jewish men, including my grandfather and my great-grandfather, were forced to collect the dead bodies in the city. This episode must have been a deeply traumatic experience for my 16-year-old grandfather, though I do not remember hearing about it in its completeness. We never learned when this happened exactly; they never told us who forced my grandfather and his father to shovel corpses; they never told what happened before and after. This story, as their other stories, was only <i>fragments</i> of the traumatic experiences they went through. The story of their suffering remains incomplete.

Hearing survivors speak about the past in fragments is not only my experience. Rose Minsky, a Polish survivor, gave an oral history interview in the early 1990s. At the end of the interview, the interviewer turned to her husband.

><i>INT: Mr. Minsky, what do you think about what your wife is doing?<br/><br/>
NATHAN MINSKY: I'll tell you the truth, I never heard her so much [? accurately ?] tell her story. We're married 50 years, and she's telling me and the children all the time certain fragments. But this time, thank to you and to the crew, that she gave you the detailed story what happened. So it's not much for me to add. What happened with the Jewry in Warsaw, what happened with people in concentration camps of Majdanek and Auschwitz, she was a witness there.</i>[[1](#fn-1)]

Similarly, other survivors also expressed the necessary incompleteness of their troubled past by drawing on the fragment metaphor. Alfred Gottschalk, a German survivor, connected the fragments of his memory with words he heard from his grandfather.

><i>INT: And so later in the year, of course, the November pogrom took place. What is your memory of that in Oberwesel?<br/><br/>
AG: I had forgotten it for many years. And then one day I was preparing a talk, which was on my inauguration as president of the college. And I had shown the talk to my son. And he said, you know, this is a nice talk. But there's nothing of you in here. Can't you-- don't you remember anything that motivated you? Then suddenly a memory came back to me of the Kristallnacht. And then I pieced it together. Because it started the night before, and there was beating on our doors, and windows, and no one actually entering the house. But it was a very frightening thing. It woke me up. Then the following morning-- we all then slept together in the living room. Following morning, my grandfather took me down to the [NON-ENGLISH], which is the place where the town gate had been originally and where the synagogue was located. And there was a brook in front of the synagogue at the time. And in the brook there was floating fragments of the prayer books and the Torah scrolls, hacked to pieces. And then we went inside the synagogue, which was completely tarred black. Now many of the synagogues were destroyed at Kristallnacht through burning. This synagogue, they couldn't burn because it was a triplex house, with non-Jews living on either side. So you couldn't burn just the synagogue, so they defaced the synagogue, tore it apart inside. And so my grandfather-- I remember in the-- wading into the Rhine River, and pulling out of it the scraps of the Torah that had been hacked to pieces, and the prayer books. And he gave them to me, and he said, here, take these. And I clutched them. I remember having this batch of wet parchment. And he said, one day we'll put the pieces back together again. And of course, that one day was never to be. ...<br/><br/>
INT: So your-- your work has been an expression-- all aspects of your work has been an expression of your experience as a survivor.<br/><br/>
AG: Well, it's my grandfather's words, you see, piecing together those scraps of parchment of Torah that were cut asunder, you know, realigning the-- the fragments to make them into a whole. I think that's been my motivating spirit and vision.</i>[[2](#fn-2)]

<i>Fragment</i> is an important metaphor in survivors’ narrations. It expresses the <i>incompleteness</i> of their traumatic past. With the help of the fragment metaphor, they describe the pieces of past -- emotional, physical, and mental -- realities in which they were forced to live. By the same token, as survivors used the fragment metaphor to describe the pieces of their past, fragment, understood as textual fragment, can render pieces of the collective suffering. 

In the context of collective suffering, however, <i>fragment</i> refers to pieces of past -- emotional, physical, and mental -- realities that <i>any victim</i> was likely to face. To differentiate a personal memory fragment by a survivor from a fragment expressing a piece of the collective suffering, I call the latter <i>testimonial fragments</i> and former a <i>memory fragment</i>.

While a <i>memory fragment</i> recurs in a survivor’s narrations of what happened to him or her, a <i>testimonial fragment</i> recurs in the narration of many survivors. Consider the following <i>memory fragments</i> by individual survivors who described the same piece of the collective suffering:

><i>I had such a fear that I am going to never see my parents again, that I quit and I went home to be with them. <br/><br/>
…when you are worried about.. uh..whatever happened to.. to your mother…</i>

These memory fragments recalling the same emotional experience, "fear for parents" <i>together</i> form a <i>testimonial fragment</i>. As a group, they express that the emotional experience of "fear for parents" was part of the collective suffering. <i>Together</i>, they convey recurrence and tell that this experience could have been the experience of any victim, including the Voiceless.

There is another important difference between a <i>testimonial fragment</i> and a <i>memory fragment</i>. A <i>memory fragment</i> expresses an experience that has minimal context; this experience happened to a given person at a given time and location. In contrast, a testimonial fragment that assembles a group of similar experiences should describe an experience that could have happened to <i>any</i> persecuted person after the mid 1930s in <i>any</i> German-occupied country. Testimonial fragments therefore have to be decontextualized. They have to express the general (<i>any</i> victim, including the Voiceless) and references to concrete space and time need to be removed. To hear the voice of the Voiceless through a testimonial fragment, the memory fragments that group to form a testimonial fragment have to be detached from the original testimony contexts where they occur.

Finally, another feature of a testimonial fragment is that its truth cannot be approached in terms of factuality. Asking whether victims, survivors or the Voiceless, were <i>in reality</i> worried about their parents is a senseless question. We do not know and we will never know. What we know is that this emotional experience recurs in testimonies, which tells that any victim was likely to face it. The truth of a testimonial fragment lies not in correspondence to an objective reality, but in its recurrence in the narration of many survivors. Again, a testimonial fragment, a piece of the collective suffering, expresses possibilities. It registers the truth of an emotional, mental, or physical experience not as a fact but as a possibility.

To sum up, a <i>testimonial fragment</i> is a form that acknowledges the necessary incompleteness of understanding the collective suffering. It is a group of short decontextualized descriptions of similar emotional, mental, and physical realities recalled by different survivors. As a group of individual memory fragments, a <i>testimonial fragment</i> expresses recurrence and the fact that any victim, including the Voiceless, was likely to face it.

Nevertheless, testimonial fragments lead to an important contradiction. Groups of decontextualized memory fragments, i.e., <i>testimonial fragments</i>, express the incompleteness of the collective suffering and the fact that they might have belonged to any victim; however, lacking any real voices and real persons, they are just impersonal descriptions of past emotional realities. While they express pieces of the collective suffering they also homogenize and schematize the victims’ suffering. As we shall see next, in light of the victims’ experience, this is troublesome because it resonates with the deeds of their perpetrators.
