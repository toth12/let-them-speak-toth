Throughout the two decades I spent with survivors, I heard many stories about their persecutions. But they kept retelling us the <i>same incomplete</i> episodes of their troubled past. For instance, I remember an episode that I often heard. At some point in 1944 the city where my grandfather and his parents stayed was bombed. The next day, Jewish men, including my grandfather and my great-grandfather, were forced to collect the dead bodies in the city. This episode must have been a deeply traumatic experience for my 16-year-old grandfather, though I do not remember hearing about it in its completeness. We never learned when this happened exactly; they never told us who forced my grandfather and his father to shovel corpses; they never told what happened before and after. This story, as their other stories, was only <i>fragments</i> of the traumatic experiences they went through. The story of their suffering remains incomplete.

Hearing survivors speak about the past in fragments is not only my experience. Rose Minsky, a Polish survivor, gave an oral history interview in the early 1990s. At the end of the interview, the interviewer turned to her husband.[[1](#fn-1)]

Similarly, other survivors also expressed the necessary incompleteness of their troubled past by drawing on the fragment metaphor. Alfred Gottschalk, a German survivor, connected the fragments of his memory with words he heard from his grandfather.[[2](#fn-2)]

<i>Fragment</i> is an important metaphor in survivors’ narrations. It expresses the <i>incompleteness</i> of their traumatic past. By the same token, as survivors used the fragment metaphor to describe the pieces of their past, fragment is an adequate representation format to render pieces of the collective suffering. In the context of collective suffering, however, <i>fragment</i> refers to pieces of past realities that <i>any victim</i> was likely to face. 

To differentiate a personal memory fragment by an individual survivor from a fragment expressing a piece of the collective suffering, I call the latter <i>testimonial fragment</i> and the former <i>memory fragment</i>.[[3](#fn-3)] While a <i>memory fragment</i> recurs in a survivor’s recall of what happened to her or to him, a <i>testimonial fragment</i> recurs in the memory of many survivors. 

Consider the following memory fragments by <i>different</i> survivors who recalled the <i>same</i> emotional experience:

><i>I had such a fear that I am going to never see my parents again, that I quit and I went home to be with them. <br/><br/>
…when you are worried about.. uh..whatever happened to.. to your mother… <br/><br/>
And we were afraid in case my father will go out in the street he will be recognized as a Jew.</i>

These memory fragments <i>together</i> form a testimonial fragment. As a group, they express that the emotional experience of "fear for parents" was part of the collective suffering; <i>together</i>, they make recurrence tangible and convey that this experience <i>could have been</i> the experience of any victim, including the Voiceless. 

I define testimonial fragment as a group of memory fragments that describe a similar experience by different survivors. In the [Fragments section](/anthology) you can see hundreds of testimonial fragments rendered as branches of a tree; the leaves of each branch are the memory fragments that together form a <i>testimonial fragment</i>.

An important feature of a testimonial fragment is that its truth cannot be approached in terms of factuality. Asking whether victims were <i>in reality</i> worried about their parents is a senseless question. We do not know and we will never know. What we know is that this emotional experience recurs in testimonies. The truth of a testimonial fragment lies not in correspondence to an objective reality, but in its recurrence over the narration of many survivors. 

Nevertheless, testimonial fragments as presented above lack any real voice and real person; they are just <i>impersonal</i> descriptions of past emotional realities; these impersonal textual fragments homogenize and schematize the victims’ experience. As we shall see next, this is troublesome because it resonates with the deeds of their perpetrators.
