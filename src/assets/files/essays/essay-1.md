During the Holocaust millions perished without leaving anything but their names behind; their suffering vanished with them.[[1](#fn-1)] Until recently those who survived could recall only fragments of the meaningless suffering that the Voiceless, as here I will refer to these millions, had to face. Symbolically, the survivors have given voice to the Voiceless; they have perpetuated a <i>living memory</i> of the emotional history of the Holocaust. Today, with the imminent death of the last survivors, the living memory is also fading and slowly disappearing. This inevitable transition has inspired this writing, which attempts to address one key question:

><i>How can we preserve the emotional history of the Holocaust so that future generations can continue to hear the voice of the Voiceless?</i>

Art, literature, and cinematography cannot perpetuate a living memory of their suffering.[[2](#fn-2)] A survivor of Auschwitz has expressed this in the following words:

><i> It's-- it's not possible to hand down the experience to the-- to the exact [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] shape of the way it really was because you simply-- you-- you just had to be there to know what it was like. You know, when we see films and all kinds of plays, we don't hear ourselves talk. Who speaks for us? The most important people in the drama are the prisoners. The most important actors in the drama are the prisoners, who were-- who were-- who can't-- they're the only ones who can pry open the inside of a person who was Hitler's prisoner. Nobody else can speak for them, somehow. Try, they do. And-- and there are eloquent writings, introductions, and everything, but [PAUSES FOR 4 SECONDS] who can lay the soul bare of the person who was the person.</i>[[3](#fn-3)]


Neither can history.[[4](#fn-4)]. The Voiceless did not leave any "record" that would enable the historian to <i>reconstruct</i> and <i>document</i> their suffering. The bitter words of the French-Spanish writer and survivor of Buchenwald, Jorge Semprún (1923 - 2011) express this and envision a gloomy future:

><i>The best witness, the only true witness in reality, according to the specialists, is one who has not survived, who has gone to the end of experience and is dead. But neither the historians nor the sociologists have so far resolved this contradiction: how to invite these true witnesses, the dead, to their conferences? How can they be made to speak? That is a question, in any case, which the passage of time will settle: soon there won’t be any more embarrassing witnesses to encumber memory.</i>[[5](#fn-5)] 


Despite the apparent impossibility, I firmly believe that we <i>must</i> attempt to give voice to the Voiceless. This is a symbolic enterprise that translates into a very concrete task: making the suffering of the Voiceless <i>tangible</i> and <i>understandable</i> for future generations. In the following collection of essays, I inquire how we can accomplish this task. I will also develop a new form of representation, the <i>testimonial fragment</i>, that will document and perpetuate the emotional and mental suffering of the Voiceless.

These essays are organized as inspired by two difficulties that arise from writing about the Voiceless. First, the word <i>Voiceless</i> is overly abstract; it denotes an invisible protagonist of history about whom we know hardly anything. One possible way to write about the Voiceless is by "escaping" to the impersonal realm of abstract thoughts, i.e., to philosophy. But abstract ideas alone tend to sideline the very human suffering of the victim who perished. Abstract thought usually focuses on impersonal ideas and arguments; approaching the question above as a philosophical problem would inevitably transform the Voiceless into an empty historical category without human feelings. The first difficulty that writing about the Voiceless involves can be summarized in one question: 

><i>How can we write about millions without being overly impersonal and abstract?</i>

Second, a written piece has to have a beginning and an end; it has to present a coherent and self-contained narrative. But what is the beginning and the end of a narration that addresses the invisible protagonist of history? The suffering of the Voiceless is still intangible; it does not exist as a coherent whole that could be narrated.

The approach that I will follow to address these two fundamental difficulties has been inspired by two old and today somewhat outdated traditions of the Western culture: turning to the self and writing in fragments of thoughts and memory.[[6](#fn-6)]

On the one hand, my own and my family’s very subjective memory will guide both my writing and my effort to reconstruct the voice of the Voiceless. I will begin each of the following short essays with a prologue in which I will recall a fragment of personal memory. Next, in the section that follows each prologue, I will expand my own fragment of memory by calling on the voice of survivors. In the second part of each essay, I will thus attempt to include the collective voice. This will lead to the third part of each essay that will include abstract reflections on the voices of the Voiceless, on collective suffering, and on the way modern technology can represent them. With this organization, I hope to address the voice of the Voiceless without being overly impersonal and abstract. This organization will also allow me to keep my own subjective memory separate from my reflections as a scholar. Finally, through the inclusion of the voice of <i>those who were there</i>, I will be able to draw on living memory in my reflections. 

I am therefore asking you to listen or watch the testimony excerpts in the following essays (complete reading time is approximately 1 hour; transcripts of all excerpts are available in the [Testimonies section](/explore)). My ideas are becoming meaningful only in concert with the memory fragments conveyed in the audio / video recordings.

My short essays will be only loosely connected; each will address a fragment of memory and thought that I believe can best mirror our fragmented understanding of the Voiceless and their experience.

As a whole, this collection of essays is not meant to be a history of the Holocaust. It is <i>just</i> an act of memory that focuses on one concern:

> <i>How can we let the them speak?</i>
