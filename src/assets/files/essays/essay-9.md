I remember one day I heard a survivor in my family talking about her experience of persecutions. Even though her story was her <i>unique</i> and very <i>individual</i> experience, she did not feel it to be so; she finished the narration of her story with the following sentence.

><i>This story has already been told many times by others.</i>

This sentence left me distressed; it signaled the triumph of her tormentors, who attempted to destroy the individuality of their victims and homogenize their experience.

The painful experience of forced homogenization recurs over testimonies of survivors. They often express it with the following sentence.

><i>We all looked alike.</i>

Eugene N., a Hungarian survivor, accounts the experience of "we all looked alike."

><i>The short guys got pants this long. The long-- the tall fellows got short pants. The shirts were not clean. Some were from boils and so on. I still had this from home, this-- I was-- I couldn't put it on. But we all looked like comedians. Not like comedians. Like clowns. Like clowns. So my father, from then on, my father said "Never, we should never separate." Let's-- wherever we go, because we couldn't recognize each other. We all looked alike. My father called-- I called my father for the first time by his first name, Naftali.</i> [[1](#fn-1)]

The account of Eugene N. contains another sentence that we often hear from survivors.

><i>We couldn't recognize each other.</i>

Elizabeth Deutsch, another Hungarian survivor, recalls this aspect of forced homogenization.

><i>But we did bear it, with my sister and many other prisoners, as long as we could. Our heads shaven, we stood next to one and another, in a large, large crowd, waiting. We didn't-- we did not recognize each other. They told us we would see our mother again, that she was just sent to take a shower.</i> [[2](#fn-2)]

In testimony given in 1990, the writer, Elie Wiesel, gave a thorough summary of victims’ experience of forced homogenization.  

><i>Before, the enemy’s purpose really was to see only one, that all the victims looked alike. And therefore these victims were ageless, faceless, nameless, and they had no private individuality. To be an individual there was dangerous. The best way to survive was to plunge into the mass and become anonymous. And not to look at the S.S. men, hoping that if you don’t look at him, he won’t look at you. But it is a childish game of, not to see him, is to be unseen. And just the opposite happened. In spite of everything, every person responded uniquely. That means there was something unique left in every person to survive the war.</i>[[3](#fn-3)]

The victims’ words above are a warning; any representation of their collective suffering cannot lead to the homogenization or schematization of their traumatic past; neither can it efface the voice of the real individual. On the contrary, the representation of collective suffering has to be informed by duality: it has to bring forward <i>both</i> the individual and the collective. This necessary duality is an ethical imperative that translates into a concrete task; in rendering pieces of the collective suffering in the form of testimonial fragments, both the collective and the individual nature of memory fragments have to be included.

In practice, the ethical imperative of dual representation means that decontextualized memory fragments representing the pieces of the collective suffering have to be told by the victims themselves. As the reader can see, this is accomplished with the help of modern technology in this edition of testimonies. In the [Fragments](/tree) section, upon clicking on a fragment, you can read the testimonial fragment in its original textual context. More importantly, you can also hear the voice of the survivor and watch the testimony section in which a given piece of the collective suffering is recounted.

On the one hand, the voice and the face of the person who was there have the authenticity of a subjective and highly traumatic experience. They convey the suffering in the past and offer a palpable representation of an emotional experience from the past to the modern reader. On the other hand, by reading, listening or watching a given piece of the collective experience as part of a person’s narration, you can explore some possible historical contexts in which that piece could take shape. In this way, individual suffering becomes the context of the collective suffering; you can explore when and where a given piece of the collective suffering came about and how a real human felt about it.

At the same time, the necessary dual representation of collective suffering is also attained by another measure taken in this publication. This is the rendering of <i>multiple</i> memory fragments that together form a piece of the collective suffering. The multiplicity of similar fragments makes recurrence tangible and expresses the fact that they could have been the experience of any victim, including the Voiceless. The multiplicity of similar fragments concurrently documents the certainty of subjective mental and emotional experiences and highlights their heterogeneity.

The ethically informed representation explained above, however, does not  answer the last question I will address here: what can words, voices, and video images recorded well after the fact say about emotional realities from the remote past?
