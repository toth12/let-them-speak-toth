    <h2>Introduction to Corpus Search</h2>
    <p>
      The corpus engine, BlackLab, empowering this projectÂ enables the searching
      of simple words and word sequences. By inserting <i>you</i> or{" "}
      <i>you went</i> into the search box, you will be given a filterable
      concordance of their occurrences, and following a click, you can read
      search results in context, i.e. in the interview transcripts. (At the
      moment listening in context is not yet available; interviews are played
      from the beginning). By means of the box on the left side, search results
      can be also filtered in terms of the following metadata on interviews and
      interviewees:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Collection</li>
        <li>- Gender</li>
        <li>- Ghetto</li>
        <li>- Camp</li>
        <li>- Interviewee Name</li>
        <li>- Interview Call Number</li>
        <li>- Recording Year</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <a href="/methods">Methodology</a> section, you can read more about
      how metadata provided by each institution had been processed and what type
      of information is behind each metadata field.
    </p>

    <p>
      To activate a search in the collection of 2700 transcripts as a linguistic
      corpus, user is now requested to use the Corpus Query Language
      (henceforth, CQL). This is a pattern matching language used to extract
      information from large body of linguistically annotated texts. How CQL can
      be applied to extract information is explained through short use case
      examples with the following structure. First, a Holocaust related research
      problem that traditional word search cannot resolve is outlined. Second,
      how CQL can help to tackle the research problem is explained; readers are
      given examples of patterns written in CQL. A more comprehensive but not
      research problem centric guide on CQL can be found on the website of{" "}

      In a linguistic corpus, the grammatical category of each word (named
      part-of-speech category and abbreviated as <i>pos</i> here), as well as
      its dictionary form (named <i>lemma</i>) are identified and stored, which
      is a computer-assisted process called linguistic annotation. How the
      linguistic corpus was constructed out of interview transcripts is also
      explained in the <a href="/methods">Methodology</a> section. During the
      linguistic annotation, to describe the grammatical category of each word,
      the abbreviated forms defined by the{" "}
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-0201-1_1" target="_blank">

      </a>{" "}
      were used. Today, this is a de-facto standard of linguistic processing.
      The grammatical categories and their abbreviated forms used throughout the
      linguistic annotation of the interview corpus can be found{" "}

    <p>
      CQL can be used to match different textual and extra-textual layers of
      interview transcripts. It can be applied to retrieve individual words,
      sequences of multiple words, and entire sentences. In addition, it can
      help to find moments of for instance long silence, crying, and sighing in
      interviews. Here we name these moments paratextual events. Finally, these
      four layers can be combined and filtered with metadata by using the box
      appearing on the left side following a search. (Another fifth layer is the
      one that would distinguish segments by interviewers and interviewees; this
      layer is not yet available). Use case examples are organized according to
      these four layers.

      <h2>Word Level Search</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      1. <b>Find all possible forms of a verb with the lemma attribute</b>:{" "}
      <i>flee, flees, fleeing</i>, and <i>fled</i>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers searching for moments in interviews when a victim is recalling the
      experience of fleeing face a difficulty: a simple search of <i>flee</i>{" "}
      would not find suffixed forms such as <i>fleeing</i> and <i>flees</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The corpus engine stores the lemma of every word in the 2700 transcripts;
      in more technical terms, each word in the corpus has a lemma attribute. As
      a result, readers can use the <i>lemma</i> attribute as a search criterium
      to find all possible suffixed forms of a noun or a verb such as{" "}
      <i>flee</i>. In CQL, attributes used as search criteria have to be placed
      between a pair of square brackets, which will then match individual words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>[lemma="flee"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This pattern matches all words the dictionary form or lemma of which is{" "}
      <i>flee</i>; the engine will return a concordance of sentences where
      different forms of flee occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, CQL can also find the occurrences of one given word
      form with the help of the <i>word</i> attribute. For instance, readers
      might want to find all occurrences of <i>fleeing</i>. In this case they
      can formulate their CQL query in two different ways that are in fact the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>[word="fleeing"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>["fleeing"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter pattern is in fact a shortcut for a search the criterium of
      which is defined through the <i>word</i> attribute. Note that matching by
      the word attribute is the same as a simple word search.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      2. <b>Disambiguation with part-of-speech information</b>: <i>fly</i>{" "}
      (meaning <i>insect</i>) versus <i>fly</i> (meaning{" "}
      <i>travel through air</i>)<br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers want to find textual contexts where victims talk about the
      experience of being bothered by flies. By entering <i>fly</i> or{" "}
      <i>flies</i> to the search box, they are also given textual contexts where{" "}
      <i>fly</i> means <i>traveling through air</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      CQL enables the combination of lemma and grammatical category, defined
      through the <i>pos</i> attribute, which can be used for disambiguation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>[lemma="fly" & pos="N.*"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This example highlights two very important features of CQL. First,
      attributes can be connected with the & operator; this expresses the
      logical relationship that natural languages express with <i>and</i>. In
      other words, the pattern above matches a given word if its lemma is{" "}
      <i>fly</i> and if it is used as a verb. Second, when defining the content
      of an attribute, CQL enables character level pattern matching, also known
      as regular expression. In the example above, the <i>pos </i>attribute,
      standing for grammatical category, is defined by the sequence of V, dot,
      and an asterisk: V.* In this{" "}
      <a
        href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html"
        target="_blank"
      >
        list
      </a>
      , readers will find the abbreviations of all grammatical categories used
      to annotate interview transcripts. But they will not find V; instead they
      will for instance find VB (base form of a verb) or VBN (past participle of
      a verb). V.* will still match all possible verbal formats thanks to
      character level pattern matching. The use of dot with asterisk indicates
      that after V there can be any number of additional characters. In more
      technical terms, dot stands for a wildcard character; the asterisk, known
      as a quantifier, tells that V can be followed by 0 or more wildcard
      characters. Hence, V.* covers both VB or VBN. In CQL, just as in regular
      expression, not only the asterisk but also other quantifiers are available
      (see the{" "}

      </a>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      3. <b>Search for synonyms with multiple lemmas:</b>{" "}
      <i>mother, mummy, etc.</i>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers want to find textual contexts where victims speak about the
      experience of mothers, which can be expressed through a number of synonyms
      (<i>mum, mummy, mom, etc.</i>). A simple word search does not include
      synonyms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With CQL readers can search for multiple lemmas at the same time; they can
      thus define an entire synonym set within one search.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        [lemma="mother" | lemma="mum" | lemma = "mummy" | lemma = "mom" | lemma
        = "mommy"]
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      {" "}
      In this pattern, the elements of the mother synonym set are connected with
      |, which is the <i>or</i> operator in CQL. The pattern finds terms the
      dictionary form of which is <i>mother</i> or <i>mum</i> or <i>mom</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      4. <b>Find terms with spelling variants:</b> <i>capo</i> and <i>kapo</i>.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The same term can be present in the data with different spellings. For
      instance, one can find both <i>capo</i> and <i>kapo</i> in the
      transcripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>[lemma = "(c|k)apo"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This pattern will match a word if the first character of its lemma is
      either <i>k</i> or <i>c</i> and if this first character is followed by the
      sequence <i>apo</i>. The first character is isolated from the remaining
      characters by means of parenthesis, which is a grouping operator; the{" "}
      <i>either or</i> relation is expressed by |.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      5. <b>Find terms with both British and American spelling: </b>
      <i>labour</i> and <i>labor</i>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Transcripts follow sometimes the British sometimes the American spelling
      system. For instance, both <i>labour</i> and <i>labor</i> are present in
      the transcripts. It is therefore recommended to run searches in terms of
      both spelling systems.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>[lemma="labo(u?)r"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This pattern will match both <i>labour</i> and <i>labor</i>. With the help
      of the ? operator, the presence of <i>u</i> is becoming optional. In other
      words, <i>u</i>, isolated as a group by means of parenthesis, can be
      absent or it can be present once. The query above can be also expressed
      with 0,1 surrounded by curly bracket, which explicitly quantifies the
      minimum and maximum number of times a character can be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>[lemma="labo(u&#123;0,1&#125;)r"]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      6. <b>
        Differentiate homonymic terms with the help of case sensitivity
      </b>: <i>Joint</i> (The American Joint Distribution Committee) versus{" "}
      <i>joint</i> (body part)
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our default search is agnostic to case-sensitivity. By searching for{" "}
      <i>joint</i> or <i>Joint</i>, readers will be given occurrences where{" "}
      <i>joint</i> either refers to the colloquial name of{" "}
      <i>The American Joint Distribution Committee</i> or to a body part. One
      thus needs to differentiate the two meanings of joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <i>Joint</i> as the colloquial name of{" "}
      <i>The American Joint Distribution Committee</i>always begins with a
      capital letter, case-sensitivity can be used to enforce CQL to find only
      those instances where the first letter is capitalized.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>["(?-i)Joint"]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Case sensitivity is enforced by means of (?-i). At the same time, the
      pattern above still matches Joint as a body part if it is at the beginning
      of a sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Sequence Matching</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
      1. <b>Search for possible word sequences:</b>{" "}
      <i>mothers were crying, mother cried, mother started to cry</i>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The retrieval of moments when an interviewee is speaking about mothers
      crying is difficult. This can be expressed in a variety of ways and
      between <i>mother</i> and <i>cry</i> there can be multiple terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>[lemma="mother"] []&#123;0,3&#125; [lemma="cry"]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This pattern matches sequences where a term, the dictionary form of which
      is <i>mother</i>, is followed by another term, the dictionary form of
      which is <i>cry</i>, within a window of maximum three words. {(0, 3)}{" "}
      signs that between c<i>ry</i> and <i>mother</i> there can be zero or
      maximum 3 terms; [] signs that the term in-between can be any word.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      2.{" "}
      <b>
        Matching sequences with similar meaning through grouping operation:
      </b>{" "}
      <i>I will never forget</i> and <i>I will alway remember</i>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Research Problem:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      A key moment in an interview when a victim tells the phrase,{" "}
      <i>I will never forget</i>. But this can be also expressed as{" "}
      <i>I will always remember</i>, <i>I couldnât forget</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      First, one needs to write two sequences in which either <i>I, never</i>,
      <i>nât</i>, which expresses negation, and <i>forget</i> or{" "}
      <i>I, always,</i> and <i>remember</i> occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
        ["I"] []&#123;0,5&#125;[word="never" | word = "n't" ] [lemma="forget"]
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>["I"] []&#123;0,5&#125;[word="always"] [lemma="remember"]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, the two sequences need to be connected as groups with the{" "}
      <i>or</i> (|) operator; grouping is done with the help of parenthesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
        (["I"] []&#123;0,5&#125;[word="never" | word = "n't" ] [lemma="forget"])
        | (["I"] []&#123;0,5&#125;[word="always"] [lemma="remember"])
