          <i>Let them Speak</i> is the epigraph of this book and the name of the
          collaborative project between three institutions that gave rise to it.{" "}
          <i>Let them Speak</i> is symbolic; it expresses my intention to give
          voice to millions of murdered Holocaust victims, to the <i>Drowned</i>
          , as Primo Levi, the Italian writer and Holocaust survivor, named
          them. Today, when the last of the <i>Saved</i>, as Levi called
          survivors, die, reflecting on how to tell the experience and
          perspective of the <i>Drowned</i> is becoming a moral obligation for
          future generations. Until now, symbolically, the <i>Saved</i> could
          give voice to the <i>Drowned</i>. To realize the impossible, I bring
          together survivors’ voice, computer science, philosophy, and my own
          family’s memory.{" "}
          <i>In Search of the Drowned in the Words of the Saved</i> is a hybrid
          publication realized with the help of digital technology. On the one
          hand, it offers scholarship on the silenced experience of the{" "}
          <i>Drowned</i> and essays on oral history testimony in the digital
          age. <br />

          edition of nearly 2700 English language Holocaust testimonies
          preserved in three major US collections: Yale Fortunoff Archive, USC
          Shoah Foundation, Visual History Archive, United States Holocaust
          Memorial Museum. As a data edition, it offers new ways to engage with
          victims’ experience. To give voice to the <i>Drowned</i>, it renders
          pieces of collective suffering as <i>testimonial fragments</i>. This
          opens reading paths along the emotional, physical, and mental
          suffering of victims and presents the Holocaust from their
          perspective. To unlock survivors’ testimonies, it makes transcripts
          available as a linguistic corpus. Finally,{" "}
          <i>In Search of the Drowned in the Words of the Saved</i> enables the
          reading, listening, and watching of the 2700 testimonies it features.{" "}

        <h2>Extended Introduction</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote className="center-text">
            <i>Tell the world</i>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Tens of thousands of audiovisual interviews with survivors of the
            Holocaust have been recorded since the end of the Second World War.
            While each testimony is the unique story of an individual, one
            commonly shared sentiment is the desire to <i>tell the world</i>.
            Thanks to the willingness of survivors to speak, despite the
            considerable emotional difficulty of doing so, hundreds of scholars,
            archivists and volunteers have been able to study and learn from
            their experiences. Nevertheless, the sheer number of available
            testimonies, as well as lack of transcripts and appropriate search
            tools, have remained a significant barrier to understanding the
            Holocaust from the perspective of the survivor and the voiceless
            victim. The overall goal of <i>Let Them Speak</i> as a collaborative
            project is to make victims’ perspective investigable and tangible
            for future generations. Again, the epigraph,  <i>Let Them Speak</i>,
            is symbolic. In addition to giving voice to the <i>Drowned</i>, it
            also refers to my intention to put victims’ experience and
            perspective at the center of future scholarship on the Holocaust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the chapters of the <a href="/essays">Monograph</a>{" "}
            section I therefore address two core questions:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                - Beyond artistic representations, how can we render the
                silenced experience of the <i>Drowned</i> as authentic
                historical source?
              </li>
              <li>
                - How can we represent and approach the Holocaust from victims’
                perspective?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            To elaborate answers to these questions, I turn to my own family’s
            memory. Fragments from family letters and personal memories with
            survivors guide me through Holocaust experiences told by those who
            were there. In the spirit of <i>Let them Speak</i>, beyond me as
            narrator, only victims speak throughout the monograph; abstract
            ideas that have long undermined any attempt to face the experience
            of the <i>Drowned</i> are explained and addressed through the voice
            of victims. I conclude by finding the silenced experience and
            perspective of the <i>Drowned</i> in pieces of collective suffering
            to be recovered from the words of the <i>Saved</i>. To approach
            collective suffering as authentic historical source, I propose the
            reinterpretation of testimony and the concept of historical fact.
            Finally, I address the place of victims’ perspective in human
            history.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, under the initiative of the Fortunoff Video Archive for
            Holocaust Testimonies of Yale University (FVAHT), three leading
            institutions responsible for large collections of Holocaust
            testimonies agreed to make transcripts, and some video material, of
            a portion of their collection available in this book. The Fortunoff
            Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies gave access to 180
            transcripts and videos recorded as part of the Holocaust Survivor
            Film Project in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The United States
            Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) contributed 1500 interviews
            recorded between the 1970s and the late 1990s. The Visual Archive of
            the Shoah Foundation at the University of Southern California (USC
            VA) gave 1000 interview transcripts recorded in the 1990s. (See the
            complete description of the data sets this book in the{" "}
            <a href="/methods">Methodology</a> section). With funding from the
            Fortunoff Video Archive, the USC Shoah Foundation, and the USC
            Viterbi School of Engineering, 
            <i>In Search of the Drowned in the Words of the Saved</i> was
            written, edited, and built by me in collaboration with the Yale
            Digital Humanities Laboratory, and in consultation with FVAHT, USC
            VA, and USHMM. This digital book brings together nearly 2700
            testimonies from these three collections for the first time, and
            allows for unprecedented forms of access, search and analysis of
            these survivors’ experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a data edition, this publication aims not only to release
            interviews in a digital format, but also to unlock testimonies by
            drawing on modern technologies such as natural language processing
            and data mining. The edition is built around BlackLab, a
            sophisticated search engine that helps readers to explore the
            collection of testimonies. A filterable and searchable table of
            contents allows readers to browse and read transcripts or watch some
            but not all testimonies. All this is in fact an ongoing effort by
            the Fortunoff Archive; further exploratory tools will soon be
            developed in the coming years. This book also commemorates those
            millions of murdered victims, who could never share their
            experience. Technology has been employed to build an anthology of
            testimonial fragments that represents the experience of voiceless
            victims. Readers can get acquainted with the way technology has been
            applied under the <a href="/methods">Methodology</a> section.
          </p>
          <p>
            These exploratory tools complement the work of archivists,
            librarians, and indexers who work to make these testimonies
            discoverable by employing rigorous cataloguing standards and
            controlled vocabularies. In fact, as the reader shall see, this
            publication builds upon their important work. It also uses
            transcriptions of testimonies that were prepared by students and
            volunteers working for the FVAHT, USC, and USHMM. Their work
            significantly contributed to this publication. Even though this
            publication is the result of a small and dedicated team, it is based
            on many years of collaborative work and was designed as a project to
            encourage further cross-institutional cooperation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creation of a data edition is not only a technological exercise.
            It also involves philological work, ethical considerations, as well
            as the contextualization of testimonies within the current
            scholarship. My essay on Holocaust testimony in the Digital Age
            treats these topics, as well as the ethical application of
            algorithms to study genocides. By the end of the second decade of
            the second millennium, the last survivors will be gone, and the
            ability to learn from them first-hand, to record their stories, will
            end. The responsibility of the coming generations is to keep these
            interviews alive, to preserve them, to make them accessible, and
            most importantly to let survivors speak – to <i>tell the world</i>{" "}
            what happened to them. This responsibility called the Monograph into
            life. Throughout the chapters of the Monograph, I reflect on how to{" "}
            <i>tell the world</i> what happened from the perspective of those
            who never returned.
