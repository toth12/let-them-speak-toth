1. Match between your method and research there

AMC researchers study many different outputs, ranging from novels to installation and performance art, from political essays to public monuments, and from online communities to hacking spaces. What unites these inquiries is a focus on the practices in which cultural artefacts are produced, distributed, and received. This emphasis on situated practices means that we are interested in the social and historical but also in the material and bodily constituents of culture-in-the-making.

What can you study with these methods? Any change that involves sequences of states; in history we have a lot of them
