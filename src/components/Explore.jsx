          In addition to search, a traditional table of contents supports the
          exploration of interviews. This leads readers to complete transcripts,
          and to the listening or watching some but not all interviews. The
          table of contents is also filterable in terms of certain metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transcripts are not fully accurate; they might feature occasional
          errors, omissions, odd formatting and deviations from the original
          audio / video tapes. The goal of a data edition is not to produce a
          completely accurate publication of data. Due to the volume of
          testimonies data and the fact that interviews were recorded and
          transcribed by many different projects using different and not always
          consistent transcription standards, this project cannot offer complete
          accuracy. Interview transcripts are undergoing a basic quality control
          that tries to find erroneous transcripts.  In addition to transcript
          errors, historical inaccuracies may be present as these are personal
          recollections and reflections of individual survivors and witnesses.
          Please take this into consideration when reading transcripts and
          contact the editor with suggestions for improvement. You can read more
          about data processing and quality control in the{" "}
